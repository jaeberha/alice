and what is the use of a book, without pictures or conversation?
I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?
but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?
Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?
Do you think you could manage it?
But do cats eat bats, I wonder?
Do cats eat bats?
Do cats eat bats?
Do cats eat bats?
did you ever eat a bat?
I wonder what I should be like then?
Which way?
Which way?
I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
I wonder if I've been changed in the night?
was I the same when I got up this morning?
But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I?
Who am I then?
How CAN I have done that?
to speak to this mouse?
O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?
Ou est ma chatte?
Would YOU like cats if you were me?
Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?
are you all ready?
Did you speak?
Found WHAT?
The question is, what did the archbishop find?
How are you getting on now, my dear?
What IS a Caucus-race?
But who has won?
But who is to give the prizes?
What else have you got in your pocket?
but why do you call it sad?
What are you thinking of?
you had got to the fifth bend, I think?
And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?
Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?
Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here?
What WILL become of me?
shall I NEVER get any older than I am now?
How can you learn lessons in here?
Where are you?
Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?
Who ever saw one that size?
Where's the other ladder?
Will the roof bear?
Now, who did that?
Who's to go down the chimney?
So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?
How was it, old fellow?
What happened to you?
A barrowful of WHAT?
how IS it to be managed?
I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?
The great question certainly was, what?
Who are YOU?
What do you mean by that?
and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little queer, won't you?
Who are YOU?
Why?
Is that all?
So you think you're changed, do you?
Can't remember WHAT things?
Do you think, at your age, it is right?
Pray, what is the reason of that?
Allow me to sell you a couple?
Pray how did you manage to do it?
What made you so awfully clever?
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
What size do you want to be?
Are you content now?
One side of WHAT?
The other side of WHAT?
And now which is which?
What CAN all that green stuff be?
And where HAVE my shoulders got to?
And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?
WHAT are you?
You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?
how IS that to be done, I wonder?
how am I to get in?
How am I to get in?
How am I to get in?
ARE you to get in at all?
But what am I to do?
why your cat grins like that?
Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?
wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?
Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?
Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
What sort of people live about here?
How do you know I'm mad?
And how do you know that you're mad?
You grant that?
Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?
By-the-bye, what became of the baby?
Did you say pig, or fig?
Why is a raven like a writing-desk?
Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?
What day of the month is it?
Why should it?
Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?
Have you guessed the riddle yet?
what's the answer?
Is that the way YOU manage?
You know the song, perhaps?
Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?
Then you keep moving round, I suppose?
But what happens when you come to the beginning again?
What did they live on?
But why did they live at the bottom of a well?
Who's making personal remarks now?
Why did they live at the bottom of a well?
What did they draw?
Where did they draw the treacle from?
so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?
Why with an M?
Why not?
did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?
What for?
why you are painting those roses?
if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?
Who is this?
What's your name, child?
And who are THESE?
How should I know?
What HAVE you been doing here?
Are their heads off?
Can you play croquet?
where's the Duchess?
What for?
Did you say "What a pity!"?
What for?
what would become of me?
How are you getting on?
How do you like the Queen?
Who ARE you talking to?
Shall I try the experiment?
Thinking again?
Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?
What IS the fun?
What is his sorrow?
Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?
With extras?
And washing?
What was that?
What is it?
You know what to beautify is, I suppose?
What else had you to learn?
What was THAT like?
And how many hours a day did you do lessons?
Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?
And how did you manage on the twelfth?
What sort of a dance is it?
Would you like to see a little of it?
Which shall sing?
Will you walk a little faster?
will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
What matters it how far we go?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
you've seen them, of course?
Do you know why it's called a whiting?
Why?
Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?
I mean, what makes them so shiny?
And what are they made of?
Wouldn't it really?
With what porpoise?
Don't you mean "purpose"?
But about his toes?
How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?
if you don't explain it as you go on?
Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?
Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?
Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Game, or any other dish?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
What trial is it?
Who Stole the Tarts?
What are they doing?
When did you begin?
The twinkling of the what?
Do you take me for a dunce?
But what did the Dormouse say?
What are tarts made of?
What do you know about this business?
Nothing WHATEVER?
What's in it?
Who is it directed to?
Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?
Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?
What would become of you?
you can't swim, can you?
Do I look like it?
you never had fits, my dear, I think?
Who cares for you?
