# Asking Questions in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"

This is my very first Git repository ever. It was created during the winter semester of 2021/2022 for the Natural Language Processing course at JGU Mainz.


It centers around "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll. I wanted to find out what nouns and named entities the points of interest are in the questions asked.


Although having a few problems at the beginning with extracting just the questions from the text, in the end the used nouns and named entities were found, listed and visualized as word clouds. Both of the used programs to detect them weren't right to 100%.


The repositories I used were:


- SpaCy by Explosion (Ines Montani et al.): https://github.com/explosion/spaCy

- BookNLP by David Bamman: https://github.com/booknlp/booknlp

- Word Cloud by Andreas Mueller: https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud

- Alice in Wonderland on Phillip Johnsen's repo: https://gist.github.com/phillipj/4944029


So please be sure to install everything beforehand.
